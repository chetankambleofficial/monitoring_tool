## ⚠️ Antivirus Exclusions (Recommended)

To ensure optimal performance and prevent false positives, add these exclusions to your antivirus software:

### Folders to Exclude:
```
C:\ProgramData\SentinelEdge\
C:\Program Files\SentinelEdge\
```

### Processes to Exclude:
```
pythonw.exe       (Helper process)
python.exe        (Core service)
nssm.exe          (Service manager)
```

### Why This Is Important:
- Antivirus real-time scanning can cause high CPU usage
- May interfere with browser history reading (domain tracking)
- Can slow down app inventory collection

## Performance Notes

The agent is designed to be lightweight:

| State | CPU Usage | Memory |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Active | < 5% | < 100 MB |
| Idle | < 2% | < 100 MB |
| Locked | < 1% | < 80 MB |

If you notice high CPU/memory usage, check:
1. Antivirus exclusions configured?
2. Multiple browser tabs with history access?
3. Large app inventory (1000+ apps)?
